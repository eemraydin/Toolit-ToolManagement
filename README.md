## Welcome to Toolit!

Welcome to "Toolit" â€“ my first MERN project. We, a team of 3 developers and 4 designers, collaborated to create this helpful web app in less than 8 weeks. Toolit helps robotics instructurers to manages their tools, parts and projects.

## Purpose

Toolit is a web application designed to assist robotics instructors and educators in managing their tool and machine inventory systems. We have observed a global increase in robotics education, yet many rely on outdated inventory management systems, such as spreadsheets lacking automation or even just verbal communication and memory. These antiquated methods create unnecessary stress and pressure for instructors and managers.

Now, we are introducing Toolit, which offers real-time visibility of inventory status, stock issues and teams and projects.
